      <description>Bio Currently, I am a Research Fellow at National University of Singapore, working with the Department of Mathematics. My research focuses on deep learning-based methods for partial differential equations.
I received my Ph.D. in 2019 at Purdue University (in US) on my thesis about spectral methods for PDEs in complex domains. Before I started my Ph.D. program, I had received a Bachelor degree in Zhejiang University (in China) and a Master degree in University of Washington (in US).</description>

      <description>Bio I am Assistant Professor in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, see my website
Previously, I was a Research Fellow in National University of Singapore. Here I was working on mean field games, stochastic control and mathematical finance.
I obtained my PhD degree from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in 2018. My PhD thesis focuses on mean field games arising in optimal portfolio liquidation, mean field games with singular controls as well as BSPDEs.</description>
